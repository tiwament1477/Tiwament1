The NLF functions as a third-party capital provider, selectively offering capital to insurance programs underwritten by Nayms. Through these investments, the NLF seeks to earn distributions, which are reinvested to generate rewards for NAYM token holders. Holders of NAYM can actively engage in governance by participating in proposals, discussions, staking, and voting.",
